asgardRanks
===========

## What it's about
The basic idea was to get the progess of players leveling speed. The official ranking table of Asgard was read and saved to a MySQL database. This was done by a cronjob for every hour. Afterwards, when you stored some data, it was possible to track progress of players' Experience gain, based on a time span. e.g. "How much Exp did player X gain in the last 24 hours"

## Discontinued
Since Asgard was shut down, this program is no more working and discontinued.
It is kept by to remember the nice time we had on Asgard. :)
