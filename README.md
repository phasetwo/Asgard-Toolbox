asgardRanks
===========

## What it's about
The basic idea was to get a progess of players leveling speed. You can read the ranking table of Asgard and compare it to older, fetched results. Then you can see, how many EXP players gained in 1 hour, for example.
The script can be ran by using a cronjob.

## Discontinued
Since Asgard was shut down, the program is no more working and discontinued.
